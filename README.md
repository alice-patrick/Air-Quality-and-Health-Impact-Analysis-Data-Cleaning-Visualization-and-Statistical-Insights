Air Quality Data Analysis: Methodology and Findings
Introduction
This project focuses on the analysis of air quality data to uncover key trends, correlations, and health impacts. The objective was to identify actionable insights for improving air quality and mitigating its harmful effects. The process included data cleaning, feature engineering, and visualizations in Power BI, culminating in evidence-based conclusions and recommendations.

Methodology
1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
Dataset Import: The dataset includes columns representing pollutant levels (e.g., PM2.5, PM10, NO2, SO2, O3), weather parameters (e.g., temperature, humidity, wind speed), and health impact scores.
Data Imputation: Missing values were handled using statistical imputation techniques to fill gaps and ensure consistency across the dataset.
Date Conversion: A Date column was created by converting timestamps into a readable format for easier time-series analysis.
Data Validation: The dataset was checked for any outliers or inconsistencies to ensure high-quality inputs for further analysis.
2. Feature Engineering
Air Quality Categories: A new calculated column, Air Quality Category, was created based on predefined AQI thresholds. Categories include "Good," "Moderate," "Unhealthy for Sensitive Groups," "Unhealthy," "Very Unhealthy," and "Hazardous."
Health Impact Score: A Health Impact Score was generated to assess the severity of pollutionâ€™s effect on public health, based on AQI values and pollutant concentrations.
Weather Aggregation: Aggregated weather parameters (temperature, humidity, wind speed) were calculated over time for easier comparison with pollution data.
3. Correlation Analysis
Correlation Study: Correlation between pollutants (AQI, PM2.5, NO2) and weather parameters was performed using Python. This identified key relationships, such as the impact of humidity and temperature on pollution levels.
Findings: Strong correlations were found between elevated temperatures, humidity, and higher pollutant levels, particularly in the "Very Unhealthy" AQI category.
4. Visualization in Power BI
The analysis was visualized in Power BI through a series of dashboards, each designed to provide clear insights into the dataset:

Air Quality Trends Dashboard: Line and stacked bar charts displaying time-series data for AQI and pollutant levels.
Weather and Air Quality Correlation Dashboard: Heatmaps and scatter plots showing interactions between weather and pollutant levels.
Health Impact Analysis Dashboard: Clustered bar charts illustrating the relationship between AQI categories and health impact scores.
Key Insights and Recommendations Dashboard: Combined insights from all previous dashboards, supported by stacked bar and column charts.
Findings
1. Air Quality Trends
Peak Values: AQI and O3 showed peak values during summer months (June to August), correlating with higher temperatures. PM2.5 and NO2 also displayed significant variability but with smaller seasonal spikes.
High Pollution Periods: The months of June to August consistently recorded the highest pollution levels, especially in relation to O3 and AQI.
2. Correlation Between Weather and Pollution
Humidity and Temperature: Higher temperatures and humidity levels were strongly associated with increased pollution, particularly in the "Very Unhealthy" AQI category.
Wind Speed: Wind speed was found to reduce pollution concentrations across all AQI categories, highlighting its role in improving air quality.
3. Health Impact
Health Impact Scores: The "Very Unhealthy" and "Unhealthy" AQI categories recorded the highest average Health Impact Scores, reflecting severe public health risks.
Low Impact: "Moderate" and "Good" AQI categories were associated with significantly lower health impact scores, suggesting minimal health risks.
4. Key Insights
Summer Months Critical: The summer months are critical for air quality management due to increased pollution levels and their severe health effects.
Focus on O3 and NO2: Reducing pollutants like O3 and NO2 should be prioritized to minimize health risks during peak pollution periods.
Wind Speed's Role: Wind speed plays a key role in mitigating pollution and should be considered when evaluating air quality management strategies.
Conclusion and Recommendations
Key Takeaways
Pollution Levels: The highest pollution levels occur during warmer months, exacerbating public health risks, particularly in urban areas.
Health Impact: Health impact is strongly influenced by AQI categories, with the most adverse effects observed in the "Very Unhealthy" and "Unhealthy" zones.
Weather Impact: Weather parameters, particularly wind speed, are instrumental in reducing pollution concentrations.
Recommendations
Regulations: Stricter regulations should be implemented to limit emissions during the summer months to mitigate air quality degradation.
Urban Planning: Promote the development of urban greenery and infrastructure that enhances natural ventilation to improve air circulation and reduce pollution levels.
Public Awareness Campaigns: Raise awareness about high-pollution periods and encourage protective measures, such as reduced outdoor exposure, to safeguard public health.
